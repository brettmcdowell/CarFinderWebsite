Introduction:
-------------
My website provides the user the ability to find the perfect car that is specifically
designed for their needs based on an input form. The website then produces an output
of cars that meet the user's needs and displays an image of the car alongside some
useful statistics. If the user cannot find a specific car that they were looking for
there is also a facility that allows them to add any cars they would like to.

How to execute code:
--------------------
1) Download zip file and unzip
2) Change directory in terminal to new unzipped folder
3) Run "npm install" within terminal
4) Run "npm start" within terminal
5) Visit "http://127.0.01:8080/" within browser

API Documentations:
-------------------
The API documentation is simply held within the unzipped folder under the filename API.HTML.
To open it simply click on it twice and it should open a website within your browser that
details all the Methods used within the server-side API

References:
-----------
I have tried to reference as much code as possible, however, there is some sections within
the client side where I haven't. The vast majority of the client-side HTML references are from 
a combination of YouTube and W3 Schools. Some of the effects such as the Waves in the background
are found from Codepen.io
